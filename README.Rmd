## Overview

rfars is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package with a set of functions that makes easier to analyze the data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's [Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars).

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the package from GitHub without the vignette:
devtools::install_github("Cesar-Urteaga/rfars")

# Or you can include it:
devtools::install_github("Cesar-Urteaga/rfars", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## Purpose

The aim of this project was to **combine the skills of creating, writing, and testing an R package**, using the R files provided in the course [Building R Packages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-packages) offered by the Johns Hopkins University through the Coursera's platform.

For this assessment, it was required to perform the following tasks:

1. Write a vignette to be included in the package using [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html) and [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/);
2. Formulate at least one test using the [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html) package;
3. Put the package on Github;
4. Set up the package's repository so that can be checked and built on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/);
5. Add the Travis badge to the package's README.md file, as soon as your package has built on Travis and the build is passing without errors, warnings, or notes.

## Workflow

In order to create this package, I followed this path:

1. Consider the steps set forth in [the check lists of Roger D. Peng](https://github.com/rdpeng/daprocedures/blob/master/README.md).
2. Create a README file with R Markdown (use the template `Github Document (Markdown`)).
3. Set up a Github repository and change the `Project Options` within the `Tools` menu and `Git/SVN` tab; select Git as `version control system`.  Thereupon, add the remote through the Git browser using the shell.  Later, edit the `.gitignore` and `.Rbuildignore` files.
4. Add and commit the files using the Git browser and push the first commit with the shell: `git push -u origin master` (subsequent commits can be pushed in RStudio's Git browser).
5. Delete the [NAMESPACE](NAMESPACE) file when you create the package's project (allow that `devtools` creates this file with the function `document()`).
6. Document the code in the [R](./R) folder using roxygen2-style documentation, and execute `devtools::document()` (or press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D in RStudio) in order to create the `.Rd` files.  Later, press the RStudio's `Build & Reload` button (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + B) and review the help files with `?`.
7. Fill the [DESCRIPTION](DESCRIPTION) file with the information of your package.  Take into account the libraries in the `@importFrom` sections of the roxygen2-style documentation to fill the `Imports` section.
8. If you want to create an [R Markdown vignette](./vignettes/using-rfars.Rmd), use the function `devtools::use_vignette("vignette-name")`; then, modify the vignette and press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K to knit it.
9. Optional: You can distribute the documentation in pdf format executing the command `R CMD Rd2pdf package-name` in the parent folder of the package.
10. In case you want to include external data (e.g., `.bz2` files), you should store them in the [inst\\extdata](./inst/extdata) folder (please refer to the section of [raw data](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html#data-extdata) of the book "R packages" by *Hadley Wickham*); moreover, use the function `system.file` to know where the external files are stored once the package is installed (see the [examples in the documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cesar-Urteaga/rfars/master/R/fars_functions.R)).
11. So as to include a battery of tests, run the command `devtools::use_testthat()` and include the tests in the [testthat](./tests/testthat) folder.  Once you have added the tests, execute `devtools::test()` (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + T) to carry out each one.  Please review the chapter of [testing](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html) in the Hadley's book. 
12. To check if your package pass the CRAN's battery of tests, click the `Check` button in the `Build` tab of `RStudio`.  N.B.: It is possible that you could get the following note: "no visible binding for global variable variable-name".  To get around of it, see the [suggested solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17807914) in stackoverflow.
13. Finally, you can include the continuous integration service of [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) to your package by running the `devtools::use_travis()` command and activating the package's repository in your Travis account; thereupon, add, commit, and push your changes in Github and insert the Travis badge into the README file.  N.B.: For the [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) service use `devtools::use_appveyor()` and check the [AppVeyor's documentation](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/status-badges/#badges-for-projects-with-public-repositories-on-github-and-bitbucket) to add the badge into the README file.
14. Optional: In case you desire to include the LICENSE file into the Github's repository, you may want to see [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37895659) in Stackoverflow.  **N.B.: Please, do not forget to include the reference of the LICENSE file into the DESCRIPTION archive** (e.g., `License: GPL-3 | file LICENSE`).
15. Optional: In order to include a [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) measure to the package using [codecov](https://codecov.io), you must need to add the package's repository to this service, include [this code](https://github.com/Cesar-Urteaga/rnoaa/blob/master/.travis.yml) in the [.travis/yml](.travis.yml) file (change the package's name), and execute the command `covr::codecov(token = "YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE")` with the ascribed token.  N.B.: Do not forget to include the `codecov` badge into the README file.
