## Workflow to create an R package

In order to create this package, I followed the following steps:

1. Follow the steps described in [the check lists of Roger D. Peng](https://github.com/rdpeng/daprocedures/blob/master/README.md).
2. Fill the DESCRIPTION file with the information of your package.
3. Document the code in the folder [R](./R) with roxygent2-style documentation.
4. Delete the NAMESPACE file when you created the package's project and allow that `devtools` creates this file with the function `document()`.
